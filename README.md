# Chron-x

Chron-x is an open source, DIY, and affordable smartwatch that can be built by anyone, from the hobbyist to the professional.

[See how I built Chron-x!](https://medium.com/@ryansiu/how-to-make-your-own-smartwatch-35ff8306c160)

## Features
- Notifications using an Android app to connect to Chron-x via Bluetooth
- Footstep tracking (in progess)
- Synchronized date/time

## How to Use
This branch contains two root directories: `smartwatch-companion`, the Android app that pairs with Chron-x; and `watchv2`, which contains the software for the smartwatch itself (written for an Arduino).

## Notes
This is a work in progress, and more information, including how to build the watch and documentation, will come soon.
